The command `saber build` creates a `public` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server to properly serve static `.html` files and other static assets.

## Built-in Static Server

You can use the built-in static server via the `saber serve` command, it automatically serves `public` directory:

```bash
cd my-site
yarn saber build
yarn saber serve
```

This is great for previewing the production build locally.

## Other Solutions

You don't need the built-in static server in order to serve a Saber application, it works just fine with most static servers, for example you can use [`sirv-cli`](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/tree/master/packages/sirv-cli):

```bash
npm i -g sirv-cli
sirv public
```

Or [`serve`](https://github.com/zeit/serve):

```bash
npm i -g serve
serve public
```

## Building for Relative Paths

By default, Saber produces a build assuming your app is hosted at the server root.
To override this, specify the [`build.publicUrl`](./saber-config.md#publicurl) in your Saber config file, for example:

```js
// saber.config.js
module.exports = {
  build: {
    publicUrl: '/blog/'
  }
}
```

## [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

**To setup continuous delivery:**

With this setup Netlify will build and deploy when you push to git or open a pull request:

1. [Start a new netlify project](https://app.netlify.com/signup)
2. Pick your Git hosting service and select your repository
3. Click `Build your site`

Since Netlify automatically rewrites routes like `/foo` to `/foo.html` when `/foo` doesn't exist, you may need [saber-plugin-netlify-redirect](https://github.com/egoist/saber/tree/master/packages/saber-plugin-netlify-redirect) to fix this.

## [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

### Step 1: Install `gh-pages` and add `deploy` to `scripts` in `package.json`

```bash
npm i -D gh-pages
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add gh-pages --dev
```

Add the following `scripts` in your `package.json`:

```diff
  "scripts": {
+   "predeploy": "npm run build",
+   "deploy": "gh-pages -d public -t",
    "dev": "saber",
    "build": "saber build",
```

### Step 2: Add `.nojekyll` to turn off Jekyll

Adding a file `.nojekyll` (with empty content) to the `static/` folder to [turn off Jekyll integration of GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/files-that-start-with-an-underscore-are-missing).

### Step 3: Optionally, configure the domain

You can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a `CNAME` file to the `static/` folder.

Your `CNAME` file should look like this:

```
mywebsite.com
```

### Step 4: Deploy the site by running `npm run deploy`

Then run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Step 5: For a project page, ensure your projectâ€™s settings use `gh-pages`

Finally, make sure GitHub Pages option in your GitHub project settings is set to use the `gh-pages` branch:

## [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/now)

[Now](https://zeit.co/docs) offers a simple, single-command deployment. You can use now to deploy your app for free.

Now has been optimized for Saber, so the only thing you need to do is to install Now. You can do this by installing [the Now Desktop app](https://zeit.co/download), which also installs Now CLI and keeps it up-to-date, or by installing [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download#now-cli) directly with npm:

```bash
npm i -g now
```

Then run the command `now` in your project, you will be given a `now.sh` URL as a response as your build is deployed, similar to the following: https://my-saber-app-dxcikdrgk.now.sh/. Click or paste the deployment URL into your browser and you will see your deployed app.

Check out [Now for GitHub](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github) and [Now for GitLab](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) for continuous intergration.

## [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

To host and deploy your site to Firebase.

### Step 1: Log into Firebase and create a new project or choose from an existing one

### Step 2: Create a new web app from the project dashboard and select "Also setup Firebase Hosting for this app"

### Step 3: Add the required Firebase scripts to the body of your site by editing a file called `saber-browswer.json` at the root of your project to include the following.

```js
export default ({
    setHead
}) => {
    setHead({
        script: [{
                src: '/__/firebase/6.6.1/firebase-app.js',
                body: true
            },
            {
                src: '/__/firebase/init.js',
                body: true
            }
        ]
    })
}
```

### Step 4: Install the Firebase CLI, login and create a firebase config in the root of your project.

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools # Install the CLI
firebase login # This will open a new browser window follow the instructions
firebase init # Follow the instructions, choose the hosting option
```

### Step 5: Add the following `script` in your `package.json`:

```diff
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "saber",
    "build": "saber build",
+   "deploy": "npm run build && firebase deploy"
```

Deploy your site

```
npm run deploy
```

### Step 6: To configure firebase to strip trailing slash (Optional)

Add `"trailingSlash: false` to your `firebase.json` config.

```js
// firebase.json example
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "public",
    "cleanUrls": true,
    "trailingSlash": false,
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Docker

[TODO]

PR welcome for using a docker image to build and serve your Saber application.
