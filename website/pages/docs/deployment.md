The command `saber build` creates a `public` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server to properly serve static `.html` files and other static assets.

## Built-in Static Server

You can use the built-in static server via the `saber serve` command, it automatically serves `public` directory:

```bash
cd my-site
yarn saber build
yarn saber serve
```

This is great for previewing the production build locally.

## Other Solutions

You don't need the built-in static server in order to serve a Saber application, it works just fine with most static servers, for example you can use [`sirv-cli`](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/tree/master/packages/sirv-cli):

```bash
npm i -g sirv-cli
sirv public
```

Or [`serve`](https://github.com/zeit/serve):

```bash
npm i -g serve
serve public
```

## Building for Relative Paths

By default, Saber produces a build assuming your app is hosted at the server root.
To override this, specify the [`build.publicUrl`](./saber-config.md#publicurl) in your Saber config file, for example:

```js
// saber.config.js
module.exports = {
  build: {
    publicUrl: '/blog/'
  }
}
```

## [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

**To setup continuous delivery:**

With this setup Netlify will build and deploy when you push to git or open a pull request:

1. [Start a new netlify project](https://app.netlify.com/signup)
2. Pick your Git hosting service and select your repository
3. Click `Build your site`

Since Netlify automatically rewrites routes like `/foo` to `/foo.html` when `/foo` doesn't exist, you may need [saber-plugin-netlify-redirect](https://github.com/egoist/saber/tree/master/packages/saber-plugin-netlify-redirect) to fix this.

## [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

### Step 1: Install `gh-pages` and add `deploy` to `scripts` in `package.json`

```bash
npm i -D gh-pages
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add gh-pages --dev
```

Add the following `scripts` in your `package.json`:

```diff
  "scripts": {
+   "predeploy": "npm run build",
+   "deploy": "gh-pages -d public -t",
    "dev": "saber",
    "build": "saber build",
```

### Step 2: Add `.nojekyll` to turn off Jekyll

Adding a file `.nojekyll` (with empty content) to the `static/` folder to [turn off Jekyll integration of GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/files-that-start-with-an-underscore-are-missing).

### Step 3: Optionally, configure the domain

You can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a `CNAME` file to the `static/` folder.

Your `CNAME` file should look like this:

```
mywebsite.com
```

### Step 4: Deploy the site by running `npm run deploy`

Then run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Step 5: For a project page, ensure your projectâ€™s settings use `gh-pages`

Finally, make sure GitHub Pages option in your GitHub project settings is set to use the `gh-pages` branch:

## [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/now)

[Now](https://zeit.co/docs) offers a simple, single-command deployment. You can use now to deploy your app for free.

Now is optimized for Saber, so the only thing you need to do is to install Now. You can do this by installing [the Now Desktop app](https://zeit.co/download), which also installs Now CLI and keeps it up-to-date, or by installing [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download#now-cli) directly with npm:

```bash
npm i -g now
```

Then run the command `now` in your project, you will be given a now.sh URL as a response as your build is deployed, similar to the following: https://my-saber-app-dxcikdrgk.now.sh/

Click or paste the deployment URL into your browser when the build is complete and you will see your deployed app.

Check out [Now for GitHub](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github) and [Now for GitLab](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) for continuous intergration.

## Docker

[TODO]

PR welcome for using a docker image to build and serve your Saber application.
