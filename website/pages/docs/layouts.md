Layouts are Vue components that wrap around your page. They allow you to have the source code for your template in one place so you donâ€™t have to repeat things like your navigation and footer on every page.

You can use the `layout` attribute to use a layout component for specific page.

Saber loads `*.{vue,js}` files from `./layouts` in your project root and [theme](./themes.md) directory as layout components, when the desired layout component does not exist, it will fallback to the `default` layout component in your layouts directory.

Layout components have a prop named `page` which implements [Page Interface](./page-interface.md) and allows you to access page attributes and more.

The page contents will be available as the default slot in your layout component, for example:

A page `pages/about.md`:

```markdown
---
title: Hello World
layout: page
---

Saber is fantastic!
```

and with the layout component `layouts/page.vue`:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h2 class="page-title">{{ page.title }}</h2>
    <div class="page-content"><slot name="default" /></div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: ['page']
}
</script>
```

This page will be rendered to following HTML:

```html
<div>
  <h2 class="page-title">Hello World</h2>
  <div class="page-content">
    <p>Saber is fantastic!</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## 404 page

You can use the `404` layout to customize 404 page.

In production build, Saber will also generate `/404.html` which will be automatically used as 404 error page by hosting platforms like GitHub pages and Netlify.
